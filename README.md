**What is Denizen Cutscenes?**

Denizen Cutscenes is a powerful and easy to use cutscene creation tool. The goal for this tool is to allow as much creative freedom as possible while at the same time making it simple to create cutscenes.

The tool has a very strong integration with DModels and Denizen Player Models which allow you to display animated models to the player in the cutscene. This is very useful for something like an intro to a boss level or displaying an animated modeled crate that gives rewards to the player.

There are also several other built-in animators that are great for cutscenes such as the fake block animator which allows you to display blocks that only the player in the cutscene can see or fake particles. Here's all the animators in the cutscene https://github.com/FutureMaximus/Denizen-Cutscenes/wiki/3.-Animators

**Path System**

The path system is what allows your camera, models, or entities to move and you can see the path you created in editor mode.
There are 2 methods of interpolation for your path which is linear and smooth. The recording system allows you to record your movement for a duration specified this in turn allows more complex movement.

**What's the difference between linear and smooth?**

Linear as the name describes is a straight line while smooth is a spline curve.
